CAT exam its adaptive exam. [^1]

Starting with easy questions, to determine your level, the algorithm uses your answer to decide how difficult the next set of questions should be.

This is the core of the adaptive test:

- **If you answer correctly (The Trainer Pushes You):** The trainer assumes you can handle that level of weight, so it gives you a **harder question** (higher difficulty). This is the system's way of finding your true limit.
- **If you answer incorrectly (The Trainer Backs Off):** The trainer realizes that question was too hard, so it gives you an **easier question** (lower difficulty) to confirm what you _do_ know.

## 100 vs 150 questions 

Candidates will be presented with a minimum of 100 items on all examinations. The maximum item count is 150 items for the CISSP.

- **Passing at 100 Questions:** If you answer a consistent stream of difficult questions correctly, the system concludes by the **100th question** that there is a 95% certainty you **will pass** (you have mastered the material), and it stops immediately. ðŸŽ‰
- **Failing at 100 Questions:** If you consistently answer questions incorrectly, especially the easy and medium ones, the system concludes there is a 95% certainty you **will fail**, and it also stops.
- **Going to 150 Questions:** If your answers are inconsistent (you get some hard ones right and some easy ones wrong), the system is unsure. It continues asking questions up to the **150-question maximum** to gather enough data to confidently place you on one side of the passing line or the other.
